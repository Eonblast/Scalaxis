log4erl 0.8.3:
==============
* Added console_appender
* Added more modifiers to the possible pattern of formats (milliseconds, short/long name of month)
* Added an extra atom in the tuple argument for add_file_appender/2,3 for specifying format

log4erl 0.8.2:
==============
* Fixed issues with log4erl process not part of the supervisor
* Added support for simple log formatters (similar to Layouts in Log4J)
* Added change_format/2,3
* Added change_log_level/1,2
* Added get_appenders/0,1

Known issues:
- When file_appender crashes, the format is lost and log4erl will use the
  default format

log4erl 0.8.1:
==============
* Fixed unnecessary formatting of date/time for file_appender
* Added add_file_appender/2, add_file_appender/3
* Added add_dummy_appender/2, add_dummy_appender/3

log4erl 0.8:
============
* Added the notion of appenders in order to allow different appenders
for loggers and changed API to reflect this
* Fixed restarting issues when appenders crash
* Added dummy_appender for testing multiple appenders
* Added get_appenders/0,1 function

log4erl 0.7.1:
==============
* Changed default behaviour of new file_logger to append in order to preserve previous logs.
* Changed file_logger_guard.erl to logger_guard.erl because this module will be useful once more
  logger types are added (e.g. SNMP loggers, Syslog loggers...).
* Added a function to change log level of loggers during run-time.
* moved utility functions in file_logger.erl to log4erl_utils.
* Added log_manager.erl in order to easily allow for more logger types
